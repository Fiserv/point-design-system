# Team Models

## Overloads

The design language was made by one person with help from another front end developer. They supported code and people making two products. The overlord monitored needs across application efforts, chose what to design , how he/she wanted it designed, and released it monthly. The design language had a budget, and the program was predictable in cadence, resources and productivity. This approach lends to the design language not able to scale/mature. Also, with a single overlord, they are not able to commit to every request.

Modern design organizations are making their way from solitary teams making a library available or a centralized team serving disconnected products towards a more federated approach.

Below is an overview of the different team models. The remainder of this presentation is primarily focused on the federated model, but they may not be the best for your company or organization.

## Solitary

A solitary team model — exists frequently in practice and has validity in some circumstances.

It’s a noble enterprise, making one’s library available. A production-grade codebase, based on an approved visual language, maintained and grown at another team’s expense.

Starting with an established asset library provides significant value to teams that lack the design and front-end development talent or capacity. It’s certainly worth a look, particularly if the library is modular enough to at least leverage parts that save some time.

This model is poor, however, for teams whose problems are only partially solved by an existing system, at best. For example, teams building transactional web apps connected to a product marketing site built with a robust library are different enough that considerable customization and/or extension is necessary.

Plus, sharing a library doesn’t mean its owners earn — or have to accept — drag on their own process or priorities. However altruistic their mindset, a solitary team’s primary motive is inward on their own product (e.g. Twitter Bootstrap, Google Material). The needs of adopting teams are a distraction from their cause.

This leaves other teams on their own, and if capable, building their own stuff.

## Centralized

A centralized team supports the system with a dedicated group that makes and spreads decisions and parts for other teams to use but may not design any actual products. Maybe they’ve created the design language and system themselves, or maybe they are implementing a vision produced by an outside agency.

The centralized system team can:

- Spread a design language, components and patterns to a broad portfolio
- Serve many product teams, free from the bias of any product’s priorities
- Identify opportunities and solicit requests to deepen a library
- Setup practices and processes to validate emerging design

However, centralized teams often lack:

- Context, normalizing solutions only indirectly grounded in actual product’s or platform’s constraints.
- Power to foster active participation of — let alone the contribution of — designers on product teams.
- Visibility into day-to-day, product-specific challenges.
- Influence on product designers to balance tradeoffs between product and system objectives.

## Federated

In recent years, systematic thinking of designers across platforms and product lines grown considerably. Google Design’s progress is the archetype. A small yet growing group of empowered designers formed what became Material Design using a “committee-by-design” approach.

Such a committee federates a system’s design direction to a representative, empowered subset of designers and leaders designated to collaborate on the system for a period of time. They make design decisions collectively, even if only a subset - or others - record, build upon and communicate those decisions through artifacts like a living style guide. Not everyone participates or gets a say. Instead, the federated group’s decisions propagate out to other product teams that leverage the outcome.

A federated team will:

- Broaden legitimate relevance to many platforms and lines of business.
- Limit perceptions of bias by representing many perspectives.
- Ease spreading the system across teams by equipping more evangelists.

Each designer’s retains autonomy for and an allegiance to their product team. Until a system has staying power, designers may limit their commitment, attend unpredictably, and even express honest, deep seated guilt even being away from their product team. To participate in this model, a designer must be able to convincingly transcend tribal affiliation for the greater good of a cohesive user journey, in how balance both their time and decisions.

## Hybrid

A hybrid approach is a combination of a federated and centralized model. In this model, a federated committee provides direction and feedback, then the centralized team creates the UI libraries, coded components, and updates the documentation. Those changes are then shared with all the product teams.

Hybrid models compensate for the drawback of only using a federated model or only using a centralized model. They can benefit from contractor support for the centralized aspect. However, hybrid models do come with some challenges:

- **There might be more people to manage and organize**. Depending on the number of your federated and centralized members, there might need more coordination. Try to keep things as lean as possible. It’s much easier to scale up when needed than starting with a large team and paring down.

- **Other managers might not understand the need for federated representatives when there’s a centralized team.** It’s common for design teams to be understaffed. Often design managers will be protective of their designers’ time and want them to focus on their product work.

- **Design direction (aesthetics) might not be clear**. Similar to a federated system, you might still have this challenge. Setting expectations around this will make things much easier if there isn’t one person setting the design direction for the system. 
Bandwidth of federated engineers. Likewise with federated systems, if your engineers are also federated, you run the risk of misalignment with code and design. We recommend trying to set expectations around engineering’s capacity.
